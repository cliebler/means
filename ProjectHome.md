as [Lifehacker](http://lifehacker.com/5432218/youtubian-bookmarklet-simplifies-youtube-adds-download-links) put it:

`The Youtubian bookmarklet makes YouTube lighter and simpler by turning the site into a one-page ordeal. It places search results and full videos on one page to avoid reloading, while advanced features like video download links are added to the sidebar.`
